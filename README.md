# 🧠 Handwritten Digit Recognition System

This project is a machine learning-based system that recognizes handwritten digits (0–9) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on the popular MNIST dataset and can accurately classify input images of handwritten digits.

## 📌 Features

- Image pre-processing and normalization
- Deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras
- High accuracy on test data (above 98%)
- Simple user interface for testing custom digits (optional)
- Easily extendable to other image classification tasks

## 🖼️ Sample Input

!sample digits and images

## ✅ Output

For each input image, the model returns the predicted digit with its confidence score.
